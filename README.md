# Breep
-----------------------

## What is Breep?

Breep is a c++ bridged peer to peer library. What does that mean? It means that even though
the network is constructed as a peer to peer one, there may be no direct connections between
two dudes, say A and B, if these connections are impossible (due to poorly configured ports, for example).
In that case, Breep will attempt to use another peer C as a bridge between A and B.
